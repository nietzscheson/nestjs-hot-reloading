nestjs-hot-reloading
==============

This is a Docker (with docker-compose) environment for NestJs development.

[Hot realoding configurations](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/hot-reload) in Nestjs have been works bad for me. In Investigation I found ts-node-dev. Only install the package npm i --save-dev ts-node-dev and fun it! (The project already is configurated). Please review nest/package.json -> start:dev

# Installation

1. First, clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nietzscheson/nestjs-hot-reloading
```

2. Init project
```bash
$ make
```

3. Show containers:
```bash
$ make ps
```

This results in the following running containers:

```bash
> $ docker-compose ps
Name              Command               State                       Ports
